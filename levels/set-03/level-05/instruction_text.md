### Time portals
This is a time portal. It sends the robot the specified amount forward or backward in time. This specific one sends the robot back 4 units of time. That way, you can get through the door before it closes. (Can *have* gotten through the door before it *had closed*?)
It may not work exactly as you expect: while it sends you 4 units of time back, you only end up 3 units before when you entered the tile as 1 is still consumed by the normal passage of time.
### Result page perspectives
You may have been wondering about the purpose of the "Global Time" and "Charge Remaining" radio buttons on the result page.

When "Global Time" is selected, the result viewer will follow the normal passage of time from the global perspective.

However, when "Charge Remaining" is selected, the result viewer will instead track the local time of the robot (as one unit of charge is drained for every local unit of time, the local time can instead be represented by the amount of charge remaining in the robot). The viewer will then highlight the current instance of the robot being viewed and grey out the rest.
