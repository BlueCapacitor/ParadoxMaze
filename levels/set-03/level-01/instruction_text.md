### Timed door
This is a timed door. It is equivalent to an empty tile when open and to a wall when closed. The timed door will only open when the timer reaches 0. This one will take 5 units of time to open.
(The door is safe the same unit of time when it is 0)
### The sleep command
The `sleep;` command tells the robot to wait still for one unit of time. It still consumes one unit of energy.
