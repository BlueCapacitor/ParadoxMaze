You have found the hint button.

On some levels, if you are stuck, you can press this button to get a hint.
I would recommend that you give the level a good try first.
If you are completely stuck, even after a hint, the button to the left of the hint button will provide you with the solution.

For this level, just enter `fd;` into the coding box (the text box at the bottom right of the window).
Then, press the run button (the one with the triangle in the top right corner).
