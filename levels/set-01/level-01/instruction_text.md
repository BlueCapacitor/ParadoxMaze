## Welcome to Paradox Maze!
You are currently looking at the coding page for the first level.
On the left of the screen is the level map. Let's begin there.

### The level map
This is the map for the first level. All level maps are grids of tiles.
You will also see a green arrow. This is the robot that you are programming.
The robot has a number written on it. This is the amount of energy that it has.
The robot is currently standing on an *"empty tile."*
Different tiles have different properties. Empty tiles are safe for robots and have no effect.
The dark-colored tiles are *"wall tiles."* If the robot runs into them, you lose.
Finally, the tile in front of the robot is the destination tile.
The robot must safely press the destination tile to win the level.

### The coding box
On the right side of the screen is the coding box.
This is where you write the code that your robot executes.
All commands are seperated by semicolons (`;`).
The first command that you need is the `fd;` command. This moves your robot forward one tile.
Give it a try!
