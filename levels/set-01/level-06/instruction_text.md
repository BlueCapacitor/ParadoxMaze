You could, if you really wanted to, type out `fd;` 13 times here.

**Do not**

Instead, we now have a repeat loop! The syntax for a repeat loop is:
```
repeat(<<Some natural number>>){
    command;
    command;
    ...
}
```
Do not place a semicolon after the repeat loop.
A repeat loop repeats the commands inside some natural of times.
Try using just a repeat loop and one `fd;` command for this problem.
