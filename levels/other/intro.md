# Paradox Maze
This game is still in development. It is very buggy and incomplete. The instructions and rules are still work-in-progress.
##The general gameplay
Hopefully, you have seen and played a "program a robot" game in the past. If you have not, http://robozzle.com/ is a fun one. The Paradox Maze is one of these games, but with a twist. If it's not obvious from the name, in this game, the puzzles involve time travel as well. Here is the general outline of the gameplay: in each "room", you program a robot to traverse a tile map and reach every target tile (not necessarily at the same time). Be careful not to run into walls, create paradoxes, or run out of energy (running out of energy does not necessarily cause you to lose, but the robot stops where it is). Each move consumes one unit of energy for your robot, so economize your moves.

You will code the robot in a small micro-language. The language will be introduced gradually.
