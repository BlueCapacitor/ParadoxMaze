Under the laws of time travel for this game, ***all timelines must be internally consistent***.
This means that there are no branching timelines or paradoxes. Any timeline that would contradict itself can not exist.
However, all internally consistent timelines are considered and the program must succeed under all of them for you to win.

For this level, you must first look to check if the door is open.
If the door is not open, then turn right and press the button so that the door had been open after all.
This would be an impossibility: the door can not be both closed and open, so it would therefore never occur.
That means, logically, that the door must have been open when you looked. You can safely go through.
However, even though the target tile is right in front of you, you can not go there directly: you must first turn right to open the door for yourself in the past.
If you do not, even though you would win in this timeline, this timeline would not be possible as no one would have opened the door.
In such a case where no timelines are possible, you loose.
After you open the door for yourself, you can safely proceed to the target tile.
